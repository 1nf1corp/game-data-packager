generalisation of doom-wad/doom2-wad directories
------------------------------------------------

generalize the doom-wad and doom2-wad directories into one meta-dir
that can be further used to do tnt, plutonia.

Steps needed to translate doom2-wad into tnt-wad:

  506  cp -a doom2-wad/ tnt-wad
  509  mv tnt-wad/usr/share/applications/doom2-wad.desktop tnt-wad/usr/share/applications/tnt-wad.desktop
  511  vi tnt-wad/usr/share/applications/tnt-wad.desktop
  513  vi tnt-wad/DEBIAN/control.in
  515  rm tnt-wad/DEBIAN/prerm
  516  rm tnt-wad/DEBIAN/postinst 
  518  vi tnt-wad/usr/share/doc/doom2-wad/copyright
    could be avoided by making this generic?
  519  vi tnt-wad/usr/share/doc/doom2-wad/README.Debian
    could be avoided by making this generic
  520  mv tnt-wad/usr/share/doc/doom2-wad tnt-wad/usr/share/doc/tnt-wad

so from the above:
    two renames
    two (remaining) file substitutions
    if we had postinst/prerm, we may need subs for those
        we have those for doom.wad and doom2.wad only

get rid of the makefile
-----------------------

Either move all the makefile work into debian/rules, or decide on a clean
split of responsibilities and keep it that way. To be honest, the latter is
more appealing to me right now. would need to add
dpkg-parsechangelog | grep ^Version | cut -d' ' -f2-
to Makefile
