TODO:

	* support {tnt,plutonia}.wad
	* ensure the doom2.wad is not +x (chmod)
	* generalize for non-doom games
		* a more suitable name?
		* show a licence where necessary
	* move stuff which is very similar from doom2-wad/doom-wad into
	* doom-common and make it specific at runtime
	* do away with ./Makefile and build entirely from debian/rules
	* re-add quake3 support (currently in a branch)
