  * update comments in make-wad-package (thanks Ben Hutchings)
  * remove dummy md5sum and doom2.wad file from package
    (thanks Ben Hutchings)
  * auto-generate md5sums in the doom2-wad .deb on build
  * remove binutils dependency
  * use Build-Depends, not -Indep (thanks Ben Hutchings)
  * make-wad-package is a bash script (not sh, yet)
  * clarify copyright (GPL-2)
  * use fakeroot again (or doom2-wad will unpack with the wrong uid)
